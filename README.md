## 🖱️ How to Use

1. Choose Duration, Text Source, and Difficulty
2. Press Start (or Enter)
3. Type what you see in “Text to type”
4. View live stats while you type
5. Press Pause or click outside input and press Space to pause/resume
6. Review your results and history after finishing

Notes:
- Spacebar behavior:
  - When typing in the input, Space inserts a space normally
  - When the input is NOT focused, Space toggles Pause/Resume

## 🎛️ Customization

### Change the Background Gradient
In `style.css`, ensure the body background is set (towards the end of the file to override earlier rules):
```css
body {
  background: linear-gradient(to right, #3b82f6, #6366f1, #db2777);
}
```

Adjust Theme Surfaces and Text
- Use the CSS variables at the top of style.css to tweak surface transparency, borders, and focus rings.

Edit/Extend Text Sources
- In script.js, update the TEXT_BANK to add/remove phrases:

```bash
const TEXT_BANK = {
  quotes: [
    "Simplicity is the soul of efficiency.",
    // add more
  ],
  pangrams: [
    "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.",
  ],
  code: [
    "for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) { console.log(i); }",
  ],
  lorem: [
    "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur...",
  ],
};
```

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

- Enter: Start test (when idle/finished)
- Escape: Reset test
- Space:
- Toggles Pause/Resume only if the input is not focused
- Types a space when the input is focused
  
Tip: Click anywhere in the typing area to refocus the input while running.

## 🧪 Scoring Details

- WPM = (correct characters / 5) / minutes
- CPM = correct characters / minutes
- Accuracy = correct / typed × 100
- Errors = total incorrect characters typed
- Best WPM is stored in localStorage under typing-best-wpm
- History is stored in localStorage under typing-history (max 15 recent results)

## 🛠️ Development Notes

- Plain HTML/CSS/JS—no build step required
- Uses requestAnimation-friendly timers (setInterval) for 100ms updates
- Respects prefers-reduced-motion for users who opt out of animations
- Focus-visible outlines and clear states for keyboard users

## 🐞 Troubleshooting

Gradient not showing?
- Make sure your gradient body rule is last in style.css, or remove earlier body background rules.
  
History not saving?
- Ensure your browser allows localStorage (not in private mode) and JavaScript is enabled.
  
Space pauses when typing?
- This project is configured so Space inside the input types a space; Space outside the input toggles pause/resume.
